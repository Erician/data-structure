# programming style
The programing style follows google c++ programming style, but, with a little difference. And the point is to make the data and operation be together, like the class in advanced object-oriented language, which make the data safe and easy to understand for other programers. Keep it in mind. don not declare variables and functions ramdomly and use micros as less as possible which would confuse people easily(see linux), and you have the responsibilities to make them easy to maintenant. So, maybe the style is different with what is already existing, and I just try to find a better one.
